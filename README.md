# cobol-plugin

## Implement:
* make items length optional
* Fix INITIALIZE autocompletion
* MOVE legal and illegal moves: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cobol/cobol_basic_verbs.htm
  (Why are they illegal, if one can assign these incompativle values at item declaration anyways?)
  
  
  
## Ask the people at GNU cobol forum:
* do they support the is common clause?
* a copy can only be in end of file or end of proc.div?. If its at the top of file it replaces main program?
* Wmy cant I have a program called main?
